title: CAN Relay Controller

For the University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team's EcoCAR2 vehicle, we
required a method of switching relays in the vehicle. Since the relays would be
distributed around the vehicle, it was ideal to control them using Controller
Area Network (CAN), which is already wired throughout.

I designed a custom controller to communicate over CAN and switch relays. The
device is based on a Freescale S08D 8-bit microcontroller. Each controller  is capable of
switching sixteen relays.
