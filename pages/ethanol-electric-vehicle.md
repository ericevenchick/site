As the Electrical Team Lead for the [University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels
Team](http://uwaft.com), I worked on developing the electrical systems for the
team's vehicle in the [EcoCAR 2](www.ecocar2.org) competition.

This three year competition is currently in progress. The second year finals
will be in May 2013, and the third year finals will be in May 2014. The team
placed third overall in the first year of competition.

Here's a short video introducing the team and the competition:
