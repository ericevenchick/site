The CrossChasm C5 project was part of my Winter 2011 co-op work term at
[CrossChasm Technologies](http://www.crosschasm.com). We needed a solution for
logging Controller Area Network traffic on modern vehicles, including hybrid and
electric vehicles.

I took on the hardware design, PCB layout, and firmware development for the
project. I worked with other members of the CrossChasm team to design the
enclosure. CrossChasm continues to develop the C5, and it is now a commercial
product.
