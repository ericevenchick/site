As part of the
[University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team](http://uwaft.com), I worked on
development of electrical systems and controls software for the team's
[EcoCAR](http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge) competition. The project was
a conversion of a 2009 Saturn Vue to a hydrogen-electric powertrain.

For the new powertrain, we used GM's third generation fuel cell stack. This was
connect to a 100 kW GM motor on the front axle, a 67 kW Ballard motor on the
rear axle, and a custom battery pack based on A123 Systems battery modules.

Some of the skills that I picked up during the competition were MATLAB and
Simulink, Freescale microcontroller development, and CAN networking.

The Waterloo team placed third in the final year of the competition. At the
competition. We also took pride in being the second fastest vehicle in the
Autocross event.
