I was reading about the
[drama](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/121069-Code-Hero-Kickstarter-Goes-Bad-UPDATED)
surrounding the game
[Code Hero](http://primerlabs.com/codehero0)
recently, and it reminded me of a game that taught me about programming:
[MOO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO).

MOO stands for **M**ulti-User Dungeon, **O**bject **O**riented. It's a
server based text game that you connect to using a Telnet client.
Once you're logged in, your user can create objects and write code to make them
do things. You can also walk around, talk to people, and kick things.

This makes the concept of Object Oriented Programming pretty obvious. You create
objects, give them verbs (method attributes) and properties (data attributes),
and interact with them. Everything, including your character, is an object.

Years ago I frequented MOO Canada. This MOO was originally set up in a
partnership with Industry Canada for education. They abandoned the MOO, but a
non-profit picked up the project. It's still alive today, and you can connect
using a Telnet client:

    telnet moo.ca 7777

A younger me found the MOO pretty fun, and fairly addictive since you could 
create anything you thought of. Of course, this was all text
based, so some imagination was required. The idea of being able to create
whatever came to my head got me interested in programming. This concept
continues to be something I love about hacking code and hardware.

I hope that Code Hero succeeds and creates a game that teaches people to code.
It think that the approach of a game is a great way to get kids into programming.
While text based games were interesting a while back, they can't compete for
kid's attention nowadays.
